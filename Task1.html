    <h1>Hazem Salameh</h1>
    <h3>24</h3>
    <h6>CIS</h6>
    <p>Work in a challenging environment in a business company or organization in the software development field where I can utilize my capabilities to advance in my career.   
        I am self-motivated,<br> ambitious and eager to learn. I am a responsible individual with strong communication skills and work ethics besides being creative, 
        focused and highly determined. I am willing to take responsibility and work independently. At the same time, I can work well in teams.
        Looking for both personal and professional growth makes me capable of working confidently under pressure. Being bilingual gives me the chance to function efficiently in both English and Arabic.
        My background and growing up experience has given me a deep insight in the culture and society together with a wider scope in the world of business.
